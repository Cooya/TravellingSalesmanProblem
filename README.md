# Travelling Salesman Problem
Project imported from https://services.emi.u-bordeaux.fr/projet/viewvc/vdc/ accomplished in second year of bachelor. We was four to realize this project. The aim was to design a program as command line interface that allows to compute solutions to the travelling salesman problem by offering four computation methods ("nearest neighbour", "minimum spanning tree", "exhaustive search" and "branch and bound").
